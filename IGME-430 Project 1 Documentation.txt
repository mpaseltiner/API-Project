Cocktail Recipe API


What your site does and its purpose.


This website acts as a storage area for different cocktail recipes. Users can view the different cocktails to see their ingredients and instructions on how to make it and they can add their own cocktails.


What part of your app does the API handle?


The API handles getting the JSON to display the cocktails and pushing new content into the JSON.


What went right and what went wrong?


Getting modal boxes to work the way I wanted to took a whole lot longer than it should have. 


If you were to continue, what would you do to improve your app?


I would definitely work on improving the way the preview of each cocktail looks. I’m not 100% happy with the way they look and I think they would be the major focus. I would also look to creating a more permanent storage for the JSON so it didn’t get reset each time the app got used.


How did you go above and beyond?


I used bootstrap to help make the website look a lot more professional and add functionality that would have taken a lot more work. The modal boxes that exist for displaying more information on each drink took me several hours to get set up properly. This was because I had to create them dynamically using JS for each drink that was to be displayed. I ran into some issues making them that ended up with me running in circles for a few hours.
